    <b class="back">Backtracking</b> <br> Copyright Â©2002 by David Matuszek
   <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
   <p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, 
       and you must choose one of these. After you make your choice you 
       will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get 
       depends on what choice you made.<br> This procedure is repeated over 
       and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence 
       of choices, your final state is a <i>goal state</i> if you didn't, it 
       isn't.</p>

    <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably 
        has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that 
        the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf.
         At each node, beginning with the root, you choose one of its children 
         to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.</p>

    <p>Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can <i>backtrack</i> to 
        continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent 
        choice, and trying out the next option in that set of options. 
        If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, 
        and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the root 
        with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.</p>
    
    <p>This needs an example.</p>
    <img class="tree" src=".\backtracking\binary_search_tree.jpg" alt="binary tree">

    <ol>
        <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
        <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
        <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
        <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
        <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an 
        abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could make. 
        There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't 
        have a data structure to tell us what choices we have. 
        (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is 
        called <i>depth-first tree searching</i>.)
    </p>
    <h3>The backtracking algorithm.</h3>
    <p>Here is the algorithm (in pseudocode) for doing backtracking from a given node n:</p>
    <pre class="code">boolean solve(Node n) {
        if n is a leaf node {
            if the leaf is a goal node, return true
            else return false
        } else {
            for each child c of n {
                if solve(c) succeeds, return true
            }
            return false
        }
    }</pre>

    <p>
        Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. 
        This is essential to understanding the algorithm. If <code class="sol">solve(n)</code> is 
        true, that means node <code class="sol">n</code> is part of a solution--that is, node <code class="sol">n</code> is 
        one of the nodes on a path from the root to some goal node. We 
        say that <code class="sol">n</code> is <i>solvable</i>. If <code class="sol">solve(n)</code> is false, then there is <i>no</i> 
        path that includes <code class="sol">n</code> to any goal node.
    </p>
    <p>How does this work?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
        <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node <code class="sol">n</code> is solvable 
        (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do is test whether any 
        child of <code class="sol">n</code> is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of <code class="sol">n</code>. 
        In the above code, this is done by the lines
    </p>
    <pre class="code">for each child c of n {
        if solve(c) succeeds, return true
    }
    return false
</pre>
<p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. 
    If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a 
    goal node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, 
    this is done by the lines
</p>
<pre class="code">if n is a leaf node {
    if the leaf is a goal node, return true
    else return false
}</pre>
<p>The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To search a tree:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node,</li>
        <li>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have searched them all unsuccessfully.</li>
    </ol>
</ul>

<div>
    <h3>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h2>
</div>
<p>Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In fact, that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.</p>
<pre class="code">
    boolean solve(Node n) {
        put node n on the stack;
        while the stack is not empty {
            if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf {
                if it is a goal node, return true
                else pop it off the stack
            }
            else {
                if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
                    push the next untried child onto the stack
                else pop the node off the stack
    
        }
        return false
    }
</pre>
<p>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timing information suggests otherwise:</p>

    <thead>
        <td></td>
        <td class="col">2 by 3 map</td>
        <td class="col">3 by 3 map</td>
        <td class="col">3 by 4 map</td>

<p>And we get these results:</p>

<h3>Example: Cindy's Puzzle</h3>

<p>I call the following puzzle "Cindy's puzzle" for historical reasons. 
    You have some number <b> n </b>of black marbles and the same number of white marbles, 
    and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line of <b>2n+1</b> spaces to 
    put the marbles in. Start with the black marbles all at one end (say, the left), 
    the white marbles all at the other end, and a free space in between.
</p>

<table class="newtable">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td  ><img src=".\backtracking\black-ball.gif"alt="blackball"></td>
            <td><img src=".\backtracking\black-ball.gif"  alt="blackball"></td>
            <td  > &nbsp </td>
            <td ><img src=".\backtracking\white-ball.gif" alt="blackball"></td>
            <td ><img src=".\backtracking\white-ball.gif" alt="blackball"></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
